# TicTacToe-PROCEDURAL MUSIC
A simple Tic Tac Toe game to have an overview around Python language and Pygame module!

*Now with procedural midi music!*



## Using the application
- Clone GitHub repository
- Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`
- Install rtmidi `pip install python-rtmidi`
- Install mido `pip install mido`

- You need to have something to receive midi messages to hear anything. For example, simplesynth.

- Run: `python main.py`

- Check what output the game has chosen for midi to select it in simplesynth (or whatever program you use)
